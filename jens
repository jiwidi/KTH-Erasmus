        Syntehtic data

We describe event generation for an individual node, it is performal oblivious to activities
at neighbouring nodes, which later can be changed.

Events are generated, for the focus node, by a 3 layered procces.

-The top level determines the event type.
-Forr each event type there is an HMM and a present state.
-An event is generated either from parameters associated with the present state or from parameters obtanied by interpolariting those of 2 neighbours states (using the walking the edges approach we describe below)

First the event type is generated by a Markov chain or a categorical distribution.
The former follow from the text below. We note that a categorical distance can be sampled from its conjunctive prior, the divichlet distribution.


Second the HMM for an event type has:
  -Meta parameters:
    -uniform di-grpah D_Call vert. Have DNNRegressor
    -Name (number)
    -# of components
    -For each components
      -poisson ( and intensity)
      -normal (and mean and variance)
      -categorical (and h,p0,p1,..pn)
  -Hyperparameters
    -Epsilon prob. of staying in state
    -for each component a prior distribution
  - a distributed prior Dir(a) for transition prob. to other states that is on the e-dim probability


The actual HMM is generated by:




Third, and edge wallev is constructed, either for all HMMS, one for each or even one for each edge, as follows.

Either it is constructed directly by defining a prob. p and the param for a normal dist. (mean and variance)
or, alternatively, these parameters are sampled from conjugate priors (Beta and Normal-gamma)

 The above construction can be used to generate a sequence of ???? as follows.
 First, for each event type i, generate a sequence of states pi,... Then replace each state by the all  p&v-replac each pair of disjoint states ??? by a sequence of parameters obatained by walking the edge ???? (described below) - Finally, for each parameter vector pv in the so obatained sequence, sample and event.

 the so obatained event sequences are mixed using the event chain (i.e, initially a categorical)

 An edge walher is equipped with a prob. p and a normal distri ???.
 H starts at 0 and generates a ????
